1.1 The Challenge of Balancing Risk and Reward

Short-term trading strategies are notoriously difficult to optimize due to the trade-off between return potential and rapidly compounding risk. In environments characterized by volatility clustering, fat tails, and autocorrelation, traditional reward-based strategies often suffer from uncontrolled drawdowns and inconsistent performance. The need for a systematic, quantitative approach to balancing risk and reward is therefore critical â€” particularly when aiming to generate sustained profitability over short time horizons.

One of the most successful examples of such balance is Renaissance Technologiesâ€™ Medallion Fund, widely regarded as the most successful hedge fund in history. The fund is believed to produce returns exceeding 60% annualized before fees with remarkably low drawdowns, leading many to speculate that it employs aggressive but risk-aware strategies grounded in probabilistic modeling and adaptive leverage. While its methods remain proprietary, it is reasonable to assume that some form of dynamic position sizing, risk-adjusted return maximization, and drawdown control underlies its performance. This research draws inspiration from these principles to develop a formulaic trading approach tailored for short-term horizons.

1.2 The Kelly Criterion: Optimal Leverage for Growth

The Kelly Criterion, introduced by J.L. Kelly in 1956, provides a formula for determining the optimal bet size in repeated probabilistic games to maximize long-term capital growth. In the context of trading, the Kelly fraction for a normally distributed asset return is:

f^* = \frac{\mu - r_f}{\sigma^2}

Where:
	â€¢	f^* is the optimal fraction of capital to invest,
	â€¢	\mu is the expected return,
	â€¢	r_f is the risk-free rate,
	â€¢	\sigma^2 is the variance of returns.

While theoretically elegant, the Kelly Criterion has practical limitations:
	â€¢	It assumes log-normal returns and stationary distributions.
	â€¢	It is extremely sensitive to estimation errors in \mu and \sigma.
	â€¢	It maximizes long-term wealth, often at the cost of short-term volatility and drawdowns.

To mitigate these issues, traders often use fractional Kelly or modify the formula with risk penalties â€” a principle we adopt in this research.

1.3 The Sortino Ratio: Penalizing Downside Risk

The Sharpe Ratio, while widely used for evaluating risk-adjusted returns, treats upside and downside volatility equally â€” a problematic assumption for most traders. The Sortino Ratio, developed as an improvement, focuses only on downside deviation:

\text{Sortino Ratio} = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_d}

Where:
	â€¢	R_p is the portfolio return,
	â€¢	R_f is the risk-free rate,
	â€¢	\sigma_d is the standard deviation of negative (downside) returns.

This ratio provides a more accurate view of risk from the traderâ€™s perspective, especially in short-term systems where upside volatility is desirable. As such, it aligns well with Kellyâ€™s philosophy of compounding only net-positive edge, while introducing an asymmetric risk control mechanism.

1.4 The Calmar Ratio: Drawdown-Aware Risk Assessment

The Calmar Ratio is defined as:

\text{Calmar Ratio} = \frac{\text{Annualized Return}}{\text{Maximum Drawdown}}

Unlike volatility-based measures, the Calmar Ratio accounts for tail risk and path dependency, making it particularly suitable for evaluating strategies over finite time windows. In short-term trading, avoiding large drawdowns is essential, not just for capital preservation, but to enable continuous compounding and maintain psychological discipline.

1.5 Why Combine These?

Each of these metrics represents a different perspective on risk and reward:

Metric	Focus	Weakness
Kelly	Long-term growth	Sensitive to estimation error
Sortino	Asymmetric risk-adjusted return	Ignores drawdown
Calmar	Path-dependent drawdown control	Ignores return volatility & upside

We propose a unified approach that synthesizes these metrics into a composite formula. The goal is to develop a position sizing and asset selection model that maximizes short-term profitability while respecting multiple dimensions of risk.
