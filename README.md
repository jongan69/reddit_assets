📄 Section 1: Background and Motivation

1.1 The Challenge of Balancing Risk and Reward

Short-term trading strategies are notoriously difficult to optimize due to the trade-off between return potential and rapidly compounding risk. In environments characterized by volatility clustering, fat tails, and autocorrelation, traditional reward-based strategies often suffer from uncontrolled drawdowns and inconsistent performance. The need for a systematic, quantitative approach to balancing risk and reward is therefore critical — particularly when aiming to generate sustained profitability over short time horizons.

One of the most successful examples of such balance is Renaissance Technologies’ Medallion Fund, widely regarded as the most successful hedge fund in history. The fund is believed to produce returns exceeding 60% annualized before fees with remarkably low drawdowns, leading many to speculate that it employs aggressive but risk-aware strategies grounded in probabilistic modeling and adaptive leverage. While its methods remain proprietary, it is reasonable to assume that some form of dynamic position sizing, risk-adjusted return maximization, and drawdown control underlies its performance. This research draws inspiration from these principles to develop a formulaic trading approach tailored for short-term horizons.

1.2 The Kelly Criterion: Optimal Leverage for Growth

The Kelly Criterion, introduced by J.L. Kelly in 1956, provides a formula for determining the optimal bet size in repeated probabilistic games to maximize long-term capital growth. In the context of trading, the Kelly fraction for a normally distributed asset return is:

f^* = \frac{\mu - r_f}{\sigma^2}

Where:
	•	f^* is the optimal fraction of capital to invest,
	•	\mu is the expected return,
	•	r_f is the risk-free rate,
	•	\sigma^2 is the variance of returns.

While theoretically elegant, the Kelly Criterion has practical limitations:
	•	It assumes log-normal returns and stationary distributions.
	•	It is extremely sensitive to estimation errors in \mu and \sigma.
	•	It maximizes long-term wealth, often at the cost of short-term volatility and drawdowns.

To mitigate these issues, traders often use fractional Kelly or modify the formula with risk penalties — a principle we adopt in this research.

1.3 The Sortino Ratio: Penalizing Downside Risk

The Sharpe Ratio, while widely used for evaluating risk-adjusted returns, treats upside and downside volatility equally — a problematic assumption for most traders. The Sortino Ratio, developed as an improvement, focuses only on downside deviation:

\text{Sortino Ratio} = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_d}

Where:
	•	R_p is the portfolio return,
	•	R_f is the risk-free rate,
	•	\sigma_d is the standard deviation of negative (downside) returns.

This ratio provides a more accurate view of risk from the trader’s perspective, especially in short-term systems where upside volatility is desirable. As such, it aligns well with Kelly’s philosophy of compounding only net-positive edge, while introducing an asymmetric risk control mechanism.

1.4 The Calmar Ratio: Drawdown-Aware Risk Assessment

The Calmar Ratio is defined as:

\text{Calmar Ratio} = \frac{\text{Annualized Return}}{\text{Maximum Drawdown}}

Unlike volatility-based measures, the Calmar Ratio accounts for tail risk and path dependency, making it particularly suitable for evaluating strategies over finite time windows. In short-term trading, avoiding large drawdowns is essential, not just for capital preservation, but to enable continuous compounding and maintain psychological discipline.

1.5 Why Combine These?

Each of these metrics represents a different perspective on risk and reward:

Metric	Focus	Weakness
Kelly	Long-term growth	Sensitive to estimation error
Sortino	Asymmetric risk-adjusted return	Ignores drawdown
Calmar	Path-dependent drawdown control	Ignores return volatility & upside

We propose a unified approach that synthesizes these metrics into a composite formula. The goal is to develop a position sizing and asset selection model that maximizes short-term profitability while respecting multiple dimensions of risk.
